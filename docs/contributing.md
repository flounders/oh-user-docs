Something bugging you in the documentation? Feel free to make suggestions.
If you have internet access, you may create issues and pull requests
[here.](https://github.com/flounders/oh-user-docs) Due to the public nature
of the documentation, any sensitive info needs to be redacted such as IP
addresses, netmasks, gateways, internal server addresses, student names, etc.
If you are unsure about the need to redact something, ask before you post it
on GitHub.
